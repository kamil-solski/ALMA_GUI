The main purpose of this repo is to provide simple GUI for X-ALMA translator. Better quantification and distillation of the model will be added in future commits.
For now 

In my project Model directory uses soft link. Downlaoded models are stored on a external drive.

#  CHANGES v1.0.0:
* initial quantization that allow for inference of the X-ALMA model on the RTX3090 (with 6GB of spare memory space)
* basic inference of provided text, docx or pdf files.
